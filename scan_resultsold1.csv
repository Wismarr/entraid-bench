"Ensure 'Phishing-resistant MFA strength' is required for Administrators","Authentication strength is a Conditional Access control that allows administrators to specify which combination of authentication methods can be used to access a resource. For example, they can make only phishing-resistant authentication methods available to access a sensitive resource. But to access a non-sensitive resource, they can allow less secure multifactor authentication (MFA) combinations, such as password + SMS. Microsoft has 3 built-in authentication strengths. MFA strength, Passwordless MFA strength, and Phishing-resistant MFA strength. Ensure administrator roles are using a CA policy with Phishing-resistant MFA strength.","No policies with phishing-resistant MFA strength found for administrators.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure custom banned passwords lists are used","Creating a new password can be difficult regardless of one's technical background. It is common to look around one's environment for suggestions when building a password, however, this may include picking words specific to the organization as inspiration for a password. An adversary may employ what is called a 'mangler' to create permutations of these specific words in an attempt to crack passwords or hashes making it easier to reach their goal.","Custom banned passwords setting is disabled.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure 'Restrict non-admin users from creating tenants' is set to 'Yes'","Restricting tenant creation prevents unauthorized or uncontrolled deployment of resources and ensures that the organization retains control over its infrastructure. User generation of shadow IT could lead to multiple, disjointed environments that can make it difficult for IT to manage and secure the organization's data, especially if other users in the organization began using these tenants for business purposes under the misunderstanding that they were secured by the organization's security team.","Non-admin users are restricted from creating tenants",,,,,,"COMPLIANT"
"Enable Microsoft Entra ID Identity Protection user risk policies","With the user risk policy turned on, Microsoft Entra ID detects the probability that a user account has been compromised. As an administrator, you can configure a user risk Conditional Access policy to automatically respond to a specific user risk level. For example, you can block access to your resources or require a password change to get a user account back into a clean state.","You have 364 users out of 417 that do not have user risk policy enabled.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure the admin consent workflow is enabled","Without an admin consent workflow (Preview), a user in a tenant where user consent is disabled will be blocked when they try to access any app that requires permissions to access organizational data. The user sees a generic error message that says they're unauthorized to access the app and they should ask their admin for help. The admin consent workflow (Preview) gives admins a secure way to grant access to applications that require admin approval. When a user tries to access an application but is unable to provide consent, they can send a request for admin approval. The request is sent via email to admins who have been designated as reviewers. A reviewer acts on the request, and the user is notified of the action.","Admin consent workflow is: false",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure 'Microsoft Azure Management' is limited to administrative roles","<p>The Microsoft Azure Management application governs various Azure services and can be secured through the implementation of a Conditional Access policy. This policy can restrict specific user accounts from accessing the related portals and applications.</p> <p>When Conditional Access policy is targeted to the Microsoft Azure Management application, within the Conditional Access policy app picker the policy will be enforced for tokens issued to application IDs of a set of services closely bound to the portal.</p> <ul> <li>Azure Resource Manager</li> <li>Azure portal, which also covers the Microsoft Entra ID admin center</li> <li>Azure Data Lake</li> <li>Application Insights API</li> <li>Log Analytics API</li> </ul> <p><em>Microsoft Azure Management</em> should be restricted to specific pre-determined administrative roles.</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Blocking Microsoft Azure Management will prevent non-privileged users from signing into most portals other than Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Purview.</p> <p><strong>Rationale:</strong><br />Blocking sign-in to Azure Management applications and portals enhances security of sensitive data by restricting access to privileged users. This mitigates potential exposure due to administrative errors or software vulnerabilities, as well as acting as a defense in depth measure against security breaches.</p>","'Microsoft Azure Management' is limited to administrative roles - 'Windows Azure Service Management API' is not yet enabled in the following policies: ""MPN Portal"", ""Acceso condicional 1"", ""Consein Azure VPN"" and 3 Additional policies. To activate this setting, take the following steps.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure 'LinkedIn account connections' is disabled","LinkedIn account connections allow users to connect their Microsoft work or school account with LinkedIn. Once a user connects their accounts, information and highlights from LinkedIn become available in some Microsoft apps and services. Disabling LinkedIn integration can prevent potential phishing attacks and risk scenarios where an external party could accidentally disclose sensitive information.","LinkedIn account connections is - Not disabled",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure password protection is enabled for on-prem Active Directory","Enable Microsoft Entra ID Password Protection to Active Directory to protect against the use of common passwords.<P> Note: This recommendation applies to Hybrid deployments only, and will have no impact unless working with on-premises Active Directory.","Microsoft Entra ID Password Protection is not configured",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure Sign-in frequency is enabled and browser sessions are not persistent for Administrative users","Forcing a time out for MFA will help ensure that sessions are not kept alive for an indefinite period of time, ensuring that browser sessions are not persistent will help in prevention of drive-by attacks in web browsers, this also prevents creation and saving of session cookies leaving nothing for an attacker to take.","Setting is: sign in frequency is not yet enabled in the following accounts: ""MPN Portal"", ""Acceso condicional 1"", ""Consein Azure VPN"" and 3 Additional accounts. To activate this setting, take the following steps.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure third party integrated applications are not allowed","Do not allow third party integrated applications to connect to your services. You should not allow third party integrated applications to connect to your services unless there is a very clear value and you have robust security controls in place. While there are legitimate uses, attackers can grant access from breached accounts to third party applications to exfiltrate data from your tenancy without having to maintain the breached account","Third party applications integration is: false",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure user consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf is not allowed","To reduce the risk of malicious applications attempting to trick users into granting them access to your organization's data, we recommend that you allow user consent only for applications that have been published by a verified publisher.","You have no user consent policy in place.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Enable Conditional Access policies to block legacy authentication","Today, most compromising sign-in attempts come from legacy authentication. Older office clients such as Office 2010 don?t support modern authentication and use legacy protocols such as IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. Legacy authentication does not support multifactor authentication (MFA). Even if an MFA policy is configured in your environment, bad actors can bypass these enforcements through legacy protocols.","You have 392 of 417 users that don't have legacy authentication blocked.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure 'Self service password reset enabled' is set to 'All'","With self-service password reset in Microsoft Entra ID, users no longer need to engage help desk to reset passwords. This feature works well with Microsoft Entra ID dynamically banned passwords, which prevents easily guessable passwords from being used.","You have 0 of 410 users who don't have self-service password reset enabled.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Enable Microsoft Entra ID Identity Protection sign-in risk policies","Turning on the sign-in risk policy ensures that suspicious sign-ins are challenged for multifactor authentication (MFA).","You have 0 of 417 users that don't have the sign-in risky policy turned on.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure multifactor authentication is enabled for all users in administrative roles","<p>Requiring multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrative roles makes it harder for attackers to access accounts. Administrative roles have higher permissions than typical users. If any of those accounts are compromised, your entire organization is exposed. At a minimum, protect the following roles:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Global administrator&nbsp;</li><li>Authentication administrator&nbsp;</li><li>Billing administrator&nbsp;</li><li>Conditional Access administrator&nbsp;</li><li>Exchange administrator&nbsp;</li><li>Helpdesk administrator&nbsp;</li><li>Security administrator&nbsp;</li><li>SharePoint administrator&nbsp;</li><li>User administrator&nbsp;</li></ul>","You have 3 out of 22 users with administrative roles that aren?t registered and protected with MFA.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure multifactor authentication is enabled for all users","Multifactor authentication (MFA) helps protect devices and data that are accessible to these users. Adding more authentication methods, such as the Microsoft Authenticator app or a phone number, increases the level of protection if one factor is compromised.","You have 344 out of 417 users that aren?t registered with MFA.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure a dynamic group for guest users is created","A dynamic group is a dynamic configuration of security group membership for Azure Active Directory. Administrators can set rules to populate groups that are created in Azure AD based on user attributes (such as userType, department, or country/region). Members can be automatically added to or removed from a security group based on their attributes. The recommended state is to create a dynamic group that includes guest accounts.","Dynamic group for all users found.",,,"System.Object[]","System.Object[]","System.Object[]","COMPLIANT"
"Ensure Microsoft Authenticator is configured to protect against MFA fatigue","Microsoft has released additional settings to enhance the configuration of the Microsoft Authenticator application. These settings provide additional information and context to users who receive MFA passwordless and push requests, such as geographic location the request came from, the requesting application and requiring a number match. Ensure the following are Enabled.
        ??? Require number matching for push notifications
        ??? Show application name in push and passwordless notifications
        ??? Show geographic location in push and passwordless notifications","Microsoft Authenticator is disabled.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure that password hash sync is enabled for hybrid deployments","Password hash synchronization helps by reducing the number of passwords your users need to maintain to just one and enables leaked credential detection for your hybrid accounts. Leaked credential protection is leveraged through Azure AD Identity Protection and is a subset of that feature which can help identify if an organization's user account passwords have appeared on the dark web or public spaces. Using other options for your directory synchronization may be less resilient as Microsoft can still process sign-ins to 365 with Hash Sync even if a network connection to your on-premises environment is not available.","On-Premises Sync is enabled.","True","7/11/2024 2:47:12 p. m.",,,,"COMPLIANT"
"Ensure 'Privileged Identity Management' is used to manage roles","Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management can be used to audit roles, allow just in time activation of roles and allow for periodic role attestation. Organizations should remove permanent members from privileged Office 365 roles and instead make them eligible, through a JIT activation workflow.","Permanent active role assignments found.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure Security Defaults is disabled on Azure Active Directory","Security defaults provide secure default settings that are managed on behalf of organizations to keep customers safe until they are ready to manage their own identity security settings.
        For example, doing the following:
        ??? Requiring all users and admins to register for MFA.
        ??? Challenging users with MFA - mostly when they show up on a new device or app, but more often for critical roles and tasks.
        ??? Disabling authentication from legacy authentication clients, which can???t do MFA.","Security Defaults are disabled.",,,,,,"COMPLIANT"
