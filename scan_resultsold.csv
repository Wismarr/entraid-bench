"Ensure custom banned passwords lists are used","Creating a new password can be difficult regardless of one's technical background. It is common to look around one's environment for suggestions when building a password, however, this may include picking words specific to the organization as inspiration for a password. An adversary may employ what is called a 'mangler' to create permutations of these specific words in an attempt to crack passwords or hashes making it easier to reach their goal.","Custom banned passwords setting is disabled.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure Security Defaults is disabled on Azure Active Directory","Security defaults provide secure default settings that are managed on behalf of organizations to keep customers safe until they are ready to manage their own identity security settings.
        For example, doing the following:
        ??? Requiring all users and admins to register for MFA.
        ??? Challenging users with MFA - mostly when they show up on a new device or app, but more often for critical roles and tasks.
        ??? Disabling authentication from legacy authentication clients, which can???t do MFA.","Security Defaults are disabled.",,,,,,"COMPLIANT"
"Ensure 'Phishing-resistant MFA strength' is required for Administrators","Authentication strength is a Conditional Access control that allows administrators to specify which combination of authentication methods can be used to access a resource. For example, they can make only phishing-resistant authentication methods available to access a sensitive resource. But to access a non-sensitive resource, they can allow less secure multifactor authentication (MFA) combinations, such as password + SMS. Microsoft has 3 built-in authentication strengths. MFA strength, Passwordless MFA strength, and Phishing-resistant MFA strength. Ensure administrator roles are using a CA policy with Phishing-resistant MFA strength.","No policies with phishing-resistant MFA strength found for administrators.",,,,,,"NOT COMPLIANT"
"Ensure 'Restrict non-admin users from creating tenants' is set to 'Yes'","Restricting tenant creation prevents unauthorized or uncontrolled deployment of resources and ensures that the organization retains control over its infrastructure. User generation of shadow IT could lead to multiple, disjointed environments that can make it difficult for IT to manage and secure the organization's data, especially if other users in the organization began using these tenants for business purposes under the misunderstanding that they were secured by the organization's security team.","Non-admin users are restricted from creating tenants",,,,,,"COMPLIANT"
"Ensure that password hash sync is enabled for hybrid deployments","Password hash synchronization helps by reducing the number of passwords your users need to maintain to just one and enables leaked credential detection for your hybrid accounts. Leaked credential protection is leveraged through Azure AD Identity Protection and is a subset of that feature which can help identify if an organization's user account passwords have appeared on the dark web or public spaces. Using other options for your directory synchronization may be less resilient as Microsoft can still process sign-ins to 365 with Hash Sync even if a network connection to your on-premises environment is not available.","On-Premises Sync is enabled.","True","7/11/2024 2:47:12 p. m.",,,,"COMPLIANT"
